## Candidate Registration API

### Overview

This API allows for the registration and management of candidates. It is built using ASP.NET Core 8 with a focus on clean architecture and domain-driven design principles.

### Features

- Register a new candidate
- Update candidate information
- Retrieve candidate details
- Delete a candidate
- Integration with Swagger for API documentation
- Caching for performance optimization
- Input validation and error handling
- Unit and integration tests

### Assumptions

1. **Basic Candidate Information**:
   - Candidates have basic fields such as `Id`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Email`, `PhoneNumber`, and `LinkedProfileinUrl`.
   - Email is unique for each candidate.

2. **Persistence**:
   - The application uses a SQL Server database for persistence.
   - Entity Framework Core is used for database interactions.

3. **Validation**:
   - Basic validation is performed on candidate data (e.g., email format, required fields).

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Proper error handling is implemented for common scenarios (e.g., not found, validation errors).

5. **Caching**:
   - In-memory caching is used for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

6. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests are created for service methods.
   - Integration tests are created for API endpoints.

### Improvements

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Add authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API.

2. **Logging**:
   - Implement structured logging using a library like Serilog to track application behavior and issues.

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Enhance API documentation with examples and detailed descriptions.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 8.0
- SQL Server
- Visual Studio or VS Code

#### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sempermort/Candidate.git
   cd candidate-registration-api
   ```

2. **Configure Database**:
   Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=CandidateDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
   }
   ```

3. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Access Swagger UI**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:7170/swagger` to view and interact with the API documentation.

### API Endpoints

#### Register Candidate
```http
POST /api/candidates
```
Request Body:
```json
{
   
                    "FirstName" = "Florence",
                    "LastName" = "McMonies",
                    "Email" = "fmcmonies0@ycombinator.com",
                    "PhoneNumber" = "364-508-8955",
                    "LinkedInProfileUrl" = "https://senate.gov/sit/amet/sapien/dignissim.json?libero=n
                    "GitHubProfileUrl" = "https://blogger.com/sit/amet/diam/in/magna/bibendum/imperdiet.jpg
                    "Comment" = "Donec vitae nisi.",
                    "FromDtm" = new DateTime(2024, 11, 15, 16, 43, 31),
                    "ToDtm" = new DateTime(2024, 11, 15, 19, 43, 31)
}
```

#### Update Candidate
```http
PUT /api/candidates/{id}
```
Request Body:
```json
{
      "FirstName" = "Florence",
                    "LastName" = "McMonies",
                    "Email" = "fmcmonies0@ycombinator.com",
                    "PhoneNumber" = "364-508-8955",
                    "LinkedInProfileUrl" = "https://senate.gov/sit/amet/sapien/dignissim.json?libero=n
                    "GitHubProfileUrl" = "https://blogger.com/sit/amet/diam/in/magna/bibendum/imperdiet.jpg
                    "Comment" = "Donec vitae nisi.",
                    "FromDtm" = new DateTime(2024, 11, 15, 16, 43, 31),
                    "ToDtm" = new DateTime(2024, 11, 15, 19, 43, 31)
}
```

#### Get Candidate
```http
GET /api/Applicant[](url)/{id}
```
